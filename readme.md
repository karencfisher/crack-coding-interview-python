### Python solutions for *Cracking the Coding Interview*

The questions and answers in the book are generally in C++. As I am 
solving the questions in Python, I am accumulating some of my
solutions. These are *not* however just translating the book's
solutions to Python. They are my own approaches, which may or may
not match the solutions provided by the author. When possible, I have
simplified the solutions.

Perhaps these will be of use to someone. ;)
